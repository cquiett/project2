My Favorite Things App

This is an app that displays the things where I like to shop online from my favorite business owners. Click on the name of the company to go to the Show page, read the description, and click on the website to shop.

For this app I used, a working full-stack application, built by me, using Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS
Adhere to the MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers.
This app has one model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.

Additionally, I used CSS styling.
